# 🏥 COVID-19 Vaccination Analysis in India 💉

## 📌 Project Overview

This project provides an **interactive** analysis of COVID-19 vaccination data across different states in India. It utilizes **Python** and various data visualization techniques to gain insights into the vaccination trends, gender distribution, and state-wise vaccination progress.

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ **Data Cleaning & Processing**: Handles missing values and converts date formats.
- 📊 **State-wise Vaccination Analysis**: Aggregates first and second dose administration for each state.
- 📈 **Time Series Analysis**: Tracks vaccination trends over time.
- 👥 **Gender-wise Analysis**: Displays vaccination distribution among male and female recipients.
- 🌍 **Geospatial Visualization**: Uses **Folium** to map vaccination centers across India.
- 🎨 **Interactive Graphs**:
  - 📉 **Bar Chart**: Comparison of first and second dose administered per state.
  - 📌 **Line Chart**: National-level trend of vaccine administration over time.
  - 🎯 **Scatter Plot**: Relationship between first and second doses per state.
  - 🏆 **Pie Chart**: Gender-wise vaccine distribution.
  - 🔥 **Heatmap**: State-wise vaccine distribution intensity.
  - 🎻 **Box & Violin Plots**: Distribution of doses across states.

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- 🐍 **Python**
- 🗂 **Pandas** for data manipulation
- 🎨 **Matplotlib & Seaborn** for static visualizations
- 📊 **Plotly** for interactive visualizations
- 🗺 **Folium** for geographical mapping

## 📂 Dataset

The dataset used in this analysis (`covid_vaccine_statewise.csv`) contains:
- 📍 **State-wise vaccination counts** for first and second doses.
- 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 **Total doses administered across different demographics**.
- 📅 **Daily updates on vaccination statistics**.

## 🏃‍♂️ How to Run the Project

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn plotly folium
   ```
2. Place `covid_vaccine_statewise.csv` in the project directory.
3. Run the Python script:
   ```bash
   COVID-19-Vaccination-Analysis-in-India.ipynb
   ```
4. Open `India_Vaccine_Map.html` to view the interactive vaccination map.
